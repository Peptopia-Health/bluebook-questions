    {
      "q": "When fitting a patient for crutches, how much space should be between the axillary pad and the axilla?",
      "options": [
        "A. 2-3 finger widths (about 1.5-2 inches)",
        "B. 4-5 finger widths (about 3-4 inches)",
        "C. 1 finger width (about 0.5 inches)",
        "D. No gap; the pad should rest firmly in the axilla"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "rationale": "There should be a 2-3 finger width gap (approximately 1.5-2 inches) between the crutch pad and the axilla to prevent compression of the brachial plexus and axillary artery, which can cause nerve damage (crutch palsy) and impaired circulation."
    },
    {
      "q": "When a patient is using crutches, the elbows should be flexed at approximately what degree?",
      "options": [
        "A. 15 degrees",
        "B. 30 degrees",
        "C. 45 degrees",
        "D. 60 degrees"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "rationale": "The elbows should be flexed at approximately 30 degrees when using crutches. This angle allows the arms to bear weight effectively while preventing strain on the shoulders and wrists. The patient's weight should be borne by the hands, not the axillae."
    },
    {
      "q": "A 2-point crutch gait involves which movement pattern?",
      "options": [
        "A. Both crutches advance together, then both feet advance together",
        "B. Right crutch and left foot advance simultaneously, then left crutch and right foot",
        "C. One crutch advances, then the opposite foot, then the other crutch, then the other foot",
        "D. Both crutches advance, then the patient swings both legs through"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "rationale": "The 2-point gait requires partial weight bearing on both legs. The right crutch and left foot advance simultaneously, then the left crutch and right foot advance. This mimics a normal walking pattern and requires some coordination and balance."
    },
    {
      "q": "Which crutch gait is used for patients who cannot bear weight on one leg?",
      "options": [
        "A. 2-point gait",
        "B. 4-point gait",
        "C. 3-point gait",
        "D. Swing-to gait"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "rationale": "The 3-point gait is used when a patient cannot bear weight on one extremity. Both crutches and the affected leg advance together, then the unaffected (strong) leg steps through. This gait requires good upper body strength and balance."
    },
    {
      "q": "Which crutch gait is the most stable but slowest?",
      "options": [
        "A. 2-point gait",
        "B. 3-point gait",
        "C. Swing-through gait",
        "D. 4-point gait"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "rationale": "The 4-point gait is the most stable crutch gait because three points of support are on the floor at all times. The sequence is: right crutch, left foot, left crutch, right foot. It is the slowest gait but provides maximum stability. It requires weight bearing on both feet."
    },
    {
      "q": "Which crutch gait is typically used by patients with paraplegia?",
      "options": [
        "A. 4-point gait",
        "B. 2-point gait",
        "C. Swing-through gait",
        "D. 3-point gait"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "rationale": "The swing-through gait is used by patients with paraplegia or those who have good upper body strength but cannot use their legs for walking. Both crutches are advanced, then the patient lifts and swings the body past the crutches. It is the fastest crutch gait."
    },
    {
      "q": "When going up stairs with crutches, which foot leads?",
      "options": [
        "A. The affected (bad) foot goes up first",
        "B. The unaffected (good) foot goes up first",
        "C. Both feet go up simultaneously",
        "D. The crutches go up first, then both feet"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "rationale": "The mnemonic is 'Up with the good, down with the bad.' When ascending stairs, the strong (good/unaffected) leg goes up first, followed by the crutches and the weak (affected/bad) leg. This allows the stronger leg to lift the body weight upward."
    },
    {
      "q": "On which side of the body should a cane be used?",
      "options": [
        "A. On the affected (weak) side",
        "B. On the unaffected (strong) side",
        "C. It does not matter which side",
        "D. The cane should be held in the dominant hand"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "rationale": "A cane is held on the strong (unaffected) side of the body. This provides a wider base of support and allows the cane to share the load with the affected leg during ambulation, reducing the forces on the weak side."
    },
    {
      "q": "When walking with a cane, which is the correct sequence of movement?",
      "options": [
        "A. Move the cane, then the strong leg, then the weak leg",
        "B. Move the cane and the weak leg forward together, then the strong leg",
        "C. Move the strong leg, then the cane, then the weak leg",
        "D. Move the weak leg, then the cane, then the strong leg"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "rationale": "The correct sequence is to advance the cane and the affected (weak) leg simultaneously, then advance the unaffected (strong) leg. This provides support for the weaker side during the gait cycle and maintains balance."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the correct technique for using a standard walker?",
      "options": [
        "A. Lift the walker and move it forward, then step into the walker with both feet",
        "B. Slide the walker forward while walking continuously",
        "C. Move the walker and both feet at the same time",
        "D. Step forward first, then move the walker to catch up"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "rationale": "With a standard (pickup) walker, the patient lifts the walker and places it about one arm's length ahead, then steps into the walker, moving the weaker leg first and then the stronger leg. All four legs of the walker should touch the floor before stepping."
    },
    {
      "q": "A patient using a walker asks where to place personal belongings. The nurse advises:",
      "options": [
        "A. Carry items in a backpack on your back",
        "B. Hold items in your hand while gripping the walker",
        "C. Tie a bag to the side of the walker",
        "D. Place items in a basket attached to the front of the walker"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "rationale": "Belongings should be tied to the sides of the walker using a bag or pouch. Carrying items in the hands interferes with gripping the walker safely. A heavy front basket can cause the walker to tip forward. Side attachment maintains balance and keeps hands free for safe ambulation."
    },
    {
      "q": "A patient with a walker wants to stand from a chair. What is the correct technique?",
      "options": [
        "A. Pull up on the walker to stand",
        "B. Push up from the chair armrests, then grasp the walker once standing",
        "C. Have two people lift the patient to standing, then place the walker",
        "D. Lean the walker against the wall and use a cane to stand"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "rationale": "The patient should scoot to the edge of the chair, push up using the chair armrests (not the walker), and once standing and balanced, reach for the walker. Pulling up on the walker can cause it to tip forward, leading to a fall."
    },
    {
      "q": "When handling a wet (newly applied) cast, the nurse should use:",
      "options": [
        "A. The fingertips for a firm grip",
        "B. The palms of the hands only",
        "C. Gloves with rubber grips",
        "D. A towel wrapped around the cast"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "rationale": "A wet cast should be handled with the palms of the hands only, never the fingertips. Fingertips can create pressure points or indentations in the wet plaster, which can cause skin breakdown and pressure injuries once the cast dries."
    },
    {
      "q": "A patient reports a 'hot spot' felt on the outside of their cast. What does this indicate?",
      "options": [
        "A. Normal cast drying process",
        "B. Possible infection underneath the cast",
        "C. The cast is too tight",
        "D. An allergic reaction to the casting material"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "rationale": "A hot spot on a cast is a warning sign of possible infection underneath. The localized warmth is caused by inflammation and increased blood flow associated with an infectious process. The physician should be notified immediately for possible cast removal and assessment."
    },
    {
      "q": "A foul odor is detected coming from a patient's cast. This finding suggests:",
      "options": [
        "A. Normal perspiration under the cast",
        "B. The cast material is deteriorating",
        "C. Infection under the cast",
        "D. A skin rash from moisture"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "rationale": "A foul odor emanating from a cast is a sign of possible infection underneath. It may indicate tissue necrosis, wound infection, or drainage of infected material. This is a concerning finding that requires prompt assessment, and the provider should be notified for possible cast window or removal."
    },
    {
      "q": "The process of 'petaling' a cast involves:",
      "options": [
        "A. Decorating the cast with stickers for pediatric patients",
        "B. Applying adhesive tape strips around the edges of the cast to prevent skin irritation",
        "C. Cutting a window in the cast for wound assessment",
        "D. Removing the cast in sections for a bivalve procedure"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "rationale": "Petaling involves placing overlapping strips of adhesive tape (moleskin or adhesive tape) around the rough edges of a cast. This smooth border prevents the cast edges from irritating and breaking down the skin, particularly at the proximal and distal openings of the cast."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the earliest sign of compartment syndrome?",
      "options": [
        "A. Absence of peripheral pulses",
        "B. Paralysis of the affected extremity",
        "C. Pain unrelieved by analgesics, especially with passive stretch",
        "D. Cyanosis of the affected limb"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "rationale": "The earliest and most reliable sign of compartment syndrome is severe pain that is unrelieved by analgesics, particularly pain with passive stretch of the affected muscles. Pulselessness, paralysis, and pallor are late findings that indicate advanced compartment syndrome and possible irreversible damage."
    },
    {
      "q": "Which principle is essential regarding traction weights?",
      "options": [
        "A. Weights should rest on the bed when the patient sleeps",
        "B. Weights must hang freely and never rest on the floor or bed",
        "C. Weights can be temporarily removed during bathing",
        "D. The amount of weight can be adjusted by the nurse as needed"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "rationale": "Traction weights must hang freely at all times and should never touch the bed, floor, or any other surface. If the weights rest on a surface, the traction is ineffective and the therapeutic pull on the bone or joint is interrupted. Weights are prescribed by the physician and should not be altered by the nurse."
    },
    {
      "q": "Buck's traction (skin traction) is primarily used to:",
      "options": [
        "A. Immobilize a cervical spine injury",
        "B. Reduce muscle spasms and provide temporary immobilization of a hip fracture",
        "C. Permanently treat a femur fracture",
        "D. Correct scoliosis in adolescents"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "rationale": "Buck's traction is a type of skin traction applied to the lower extremity, primarily used to reduce muscle spasms and provide temporary immobilization, especially for hip fractures before surgical repair. It uses a foam boot or tape applied to the skin with a weight of 5-10 pounds."
    },
    {
      "q": "A patient in skeletal traction is most at risk for which complication?",
      "options": [
        "A. Skin breakdown only",
        "B. Osteomyelitis (bone infection)",
        "C. Deep vein thrombosis only",
        "D. Constipation only"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "rationale": "Skeletal traction uses pins, wires, or tongs inserted directly into the bone, creating a portal of entry for microorganisms. This places the patient at significant risk for osteomyelitis (bone infection). Pin site care with sterile technique is essential to minimize infection risk."
    },
    {
      "q": "Pin care for skeletal traction should be performed using:",
      "options": [
        "A. Clean technique with soap and water",
        "B. Sterile technique as prescribed",
        "C. Hydrogen peroxide without rinsing",
        "D. No care is needed; the pin sites are self-cleaning"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "rationale": "Skeletal pin care must be performed using sterile technique as prescribed by the healthcare provider. This typically involves cleaning pin sites with prescribed solutions (often chlorhexidine or saline) to prevent infection. Sterile technique reduces the risk of osteomyelitis."
    },
    {
      "q": "A nurse is caring for a patient in skeletal traction. The patient asks to have the traction removed briefly to reposition. The nurse responds:",
      "options": [
        "A. 'I can remove it for 5 minutes while you get comfortable.'",
        "B. 'Skeletal traction should never be released; let me help you reposition within the traction.'",
        "C. 'I need a physician's order to remove it, but I will call now.'",
        "D. 'Only skin traction can be removed; let me convert yours to skin traction first.'"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "rationale": "Skeletal traction must never be removed or released by the nurse. The pins are surgically placed and the traction maintains bone alignment. Removal could cause displacement and further injury. Skin traction (like Buck's) may be intermittently removed per orders, but skeletal traction is continuous."
    },
    {
      "q": "After a total hip replacement, the nurse should prevent which position?",
      "options": [
        "A. Abduction of the affected leg",
        "B. Adduction of the affected leg past the midline",
        "C. Elevation of the head of bed to 45 degrees",
        "D. Slight external rotation of the affected leg"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "rationale": "After a total hip replacement (THR), adduction past the midline must be avoided because it can cause dislocation of the prosthesis. An abduction pillow is placed between the legs to maintain the hip in an abducted position. Other restrictions include no hip flexion greater than 90 degrees and no internal rotation."
    },
    {
      "q": "A patient who had a below-knee amputation (BKA) should be encouraged to lie in which position to prevent hip flexion contractures?",
      "options": [
        "A. Supine with the stump elevated on pillows indefinitely",
        "B. Prone position for periods throughout the day",
        "C. Side-lying on the affected side at all times",
        "D. Semi-Fowler's position with the stump dependent"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "rationale": "A BKA patient should lie in the prone position periodically to prevent hip flexion contractures. While the stump is elevated on a pillow for the first 24-48 hours to reduce edema, prolonged elevation promotes hip flexion contractures. Prone positioning stretches the hip flexors."
    },
    {
      "q": "A patient reports pain in a limb that has been amputated. The nurse should:",
      "options": [
        "A. Explain that the limb is gone and pain cannot be real",
        "B. Acknowledge the pain as real and treat it appropriately",
        "C. Ignore the complaint as it is a psychological issue",
        "D. Suggest the patient is seeking attention"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "rationale": "Phantom limb pain is a real phenomenon caused by nerve signals from the residual limb being interpreted by the brain as coming from the missing limb. The nurse should acknowledge the pain as real and treat it with prescribed medications, mirror therapy, TENS, or other modalities. Never dismiss the patient's pain."
    },
    {
      "q": "Which characteristic distinguishes rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from osteoarthritis (OA)?",
      "options": [
        "A. RA affects only one joint at a time",
        "B. RA is a systemic, symmetric autoimmune disease",
        "C. RA is caused by wear and tear on joints",
        "D. RA never affects the hands"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "rationale": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by symmetric joint involvement (both sides of the body). It involves inflammation of the synovial membrane and can affect multiple organ systems. OA is a degenerative, non-symmetric, non-systemic disease caused by joint wear and tear."
    },
    {
      "q": "A patient with osteoarthritis reports that joint pain worsens at which time?",
      "options": [
        "A. In the morning before activity",
        "B. After rest and inactivity",
        "C. After activity and use of the joint",
        "D. During sleep"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "rationale": "Osteoarthritis (OA) pain characteristically worsens with activity and use of the affected joint and is relieved by rest. This is in contrast to RA, where morning stiffness is prominent and improves with activity. OA is a degenerative process where joint use causes increased friction and pain."
    },
    {
      "q": "A patient with gout is educated to avoid which foods?",
      "options": [
        "A. Fresh fruits and vegetables",
        "B. Whole grains and lean chicken",
        "C. Organ meats, shellfish, and alcohol",
        "D. Low-fat dairy products"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "rationale": "Gout is caused by elevated uric acid levels and the deposition of urate crystals in joints. Foods high in purines (organ meats like liver and kidneys, shellfish, sardines, anchovies) and alcohol should be avoided as they increase uric acid production. Low-fat dairy and fresh fruits and vegetables are generally safe."
    },
    {
      "q": "A patient with a long bone fracture develops sudden dyspnea, confusion, and a petechial rash on the chest. The nurse suspects:",
      "options": [
        "A. Pulmonary embolism",
        "B. Fat embolism syndrome",
        "C. Pneumothorax",
        "D. Myocardial infarction"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "rationale": "The classic triad of fat embolism syndrome is respiratory distress (dyspnea, tachypnea), neurological changes (confusion, restlessness), and a petechial rash (especially on the chest, axillae, and conjunctivae). Petechiae are the distinguishing sign that differentiates fat embolism from other pulmonary emergencies."
    },
    {
      "q": "A patient with scoliosis is prescribed a Milwaukee brace. How many hours per day should it be worn?",
      "options": [
        "A. 8 hours (during sleep)",
        "B. 12 hours per day",
        "C. 23 hours per day",
        "D. Only during physical activity"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "rationale": "The Milwaukee brace for scoliosis must be worn 23 hours per day to be effective. It is removed for only 1 hour daily for bathing and skin care. Consistent wear is critical for preventing curve progression in adolescents with scoliosis. Compliance is essential for treatment success."
    },
    {
      "q": "Kyphosis is characterized by:",
      "options": [
        "A. Lateral curvature of the spine",
        "B. Excessive outward curvature of the thoracic spine (rounded upper back)",
        "C. Excessive inward curvature of the lumbar spine",
        "D. Complete straightening of the spinal curves"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "rationale": "Kyphosis is an excessive outward curvature (convexity) of the thoracic spine, resulting in a rounded or 'hunchback' appearance. It can be caused by osteoporosis, compression fractures, poor posture, or Scheuermann's disease. It is different from scoliosis (lateral curvature) and lordosis (lumbar inward curvature)."
    },
    {
      "q": "Lordosis is characterized by:",
      "options": [
        "A. Lateral curvature of the spine",
        "B. Excessive outward curvature of the thoracic spine",
        "C. Excessive inward curvature of the lumbar spine (swayback)",
        "D. Twisting of the vertebral column"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "rationale": "Lordosis is an excessive inward curvature (concavity) of the lumbar spine, commonly called 'swayback.' It results in a pronounced curve in the lower back. It can be seen in pregnancy, obesity, and certain neuromuscular conditions. It is distinct from kyphosis (thoracic curvature) and scoliosis (lateral curvature)."

    {
      "q": "The mnemonic for stair navigation with an assistive device is:",
      "options": [
        "A. 'Strong goes first, weak follows behind'",
        "B. 'Up with the good, down with the bad'",
        "C. 'Lead with the device, follow with the feet'",
        "D. 'Bad foot up, good foot down'"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "rationale": "'Up with the good, down with the bad' is the standard mnemonic for stair navigation. When going UP stairs, the strong (good) leg leads. When going DOWN stairs, the affected (bad) leg and the crutches or cane go first. This places the workload on the stronger extremity in both directions."
    },
    {
      "q": "The handle of a cane should be at the level of the patient's:",
      "options": [
        "A. Iliac crest",

        "C. Umbilicus",
        "D. Anterior superior iliac spine"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "rationale": "The handle of a cane should be at the level of the greater trochanter (hip joint), which allows approximately 30 degrees of elbow flexion when the cane is held. This height provides optimal leverage and support during ambulation. A cane that is too short or too tall leads to improper body mechanics."

    {
      "q": "Tennis balls are placed on walkers to:",
      "options": [
        "A. Make the walker more visible to others",
        "B. Allow the walker to glide smoothly on floors and prevent catching on surfaces",
        "C. Add extra weight for stability",
        "D. Protect hardwood floors from damage"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "rationale": "Tennis balls placed on the rear legs of a walker help the device glide smoothly across various floor surfaces and prevent the walker legs from catching on carpet or uneven surfaces. This makes advancing the walker easier, especially for patients with limited upper body strength."

      "q": "A Continuous Passive Motion (CPM) machine is most commonly used after which surgery?",
      "options": [
        "A. Total hip replacement",
        "B. Total knee replacement",
        "C. Spinal fusion",
        "D. Shoulder arthroscopy"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "rationale": "A CPM machine is most commonly used after total knee replacement (TKR). It continuously moves the knee joint through a prescribed range of motion to prevent joint stiffness, reduce edema, promote healing, and decrease the risk of adhesion formation. The ROM is gradually increased per the surgeon's orders."

        "A. 7-10 days",
        "B. 2-3 weeks",
        "C. 4-6 weeks",
        "D. 8-12 weeks"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "rationale": "Osteomyelitis (bone infection) requires prolonged IV antibiotic therapy, typically 4-6 weeks, because bone has limited blood supply and antibiotics penetrate bone tissue slowly.
